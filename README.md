ultraproxy.js is a small and simple agressively caching proxy. It is horribly standards non-compliant and will most likely break lost of things. Do not use it if you don't know what you're doing!

ultraproxy.js is meant for offline replay of simple web content. I developed it for use with my HTML based presentation framework jSlide to show off online content on my offline presentation laptop.
